                <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Alejandra Reyes, and I am currently
                    a student at the UCR Extension's Coding Bootcamp. I graduated with my B.A. in Business
                    Economics from the University of California, Riverside in 2017. I decided to switch career
                    paths when I continuously saw a need for developers in my previous position. I worked in 
                    outside sales, so I had much exerience working with businesses in multiple cities. I realized
                    how a majority of these businesses had little to no online presence, and it motivated me to
                    try and fill a gap in this area. I aspire to provide the skillsets I will learn to help smaller
                    businesses in lower income communities that don't have or know about programs to help them build
                    an online presence. This will not only help the businesses develop, but also the communities.
                </p>
                <p>On a lighter note, I am a goofy, empathetic, and outgoing person. I am always the person 
                    trying to motivate people and congratulate others on their accomplishments. I firmly believe
                    that there is enough space for everyone to succeed, and that we can all accomplish more when
                    we build eachother up. I know I haven't learned everything yet, but there's so much power in yet.
                    There's power in remembering that though we may not know something yet, we have the opportunity
                    to learn it in the future.
